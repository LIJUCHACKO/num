## Donate help and feedback

If you have ideas, advice, or feedback, the best way to help is by using our GitHub page and using the "New Issue" link: [https://www.github.com/numcommand/num](https://www.github.com/numcommand/num)

If you want to help with programming, we love pull requests. Simply fork the repo, add your work, and send us a pull request. If you are able to understand our tests and run them, or you can to add your own tests, that's great.

We like using GitHub because all the project programmers have access to the issues and files, and all the project users will be able to see our progress.


## Donate via email

If you prefer to donate other ways, you can always reach us by email at <a href="mailto:num@numcommand.com">num@numcommand.com</a>.

If you would like to donate a large amount, or become a corporate sponsor, the best way is to email us and we'll make it easy for you. We aim to apply to become an official United States 501(c)(3) nonprofit.
