## Donate help and feedback

To donate ideas and advice, the best way is our GitHub page and "New Issue" link: [https://www.github.com/numcommand/num](https://www.github.com/numcommand/num)

To donate help programming, the best way is our GithUb page and a pull request: fork the repo, add your work, and do a pull request.

We like using GitHub because all the project programmers have access to the issues and files, and all the project users will be able to see our progress.


## Donate via email

If you prefer to donate other ways, you can always reach us by email at <a href="mailto:num@numcommand.com">num@numcommand.com</a>.

If you would like to donate a large amount, or become a corporate sponsor, the best way is to email us and we'll make it easy for you. We aim to apply to become an official United States 501(c)(3) nonprofit.
