The relevant files are in the directory `implemenations/num-awk`.

The `num` script is the main script that users download.

   * The script has the command line parsing, help, etc.

   * The script includes all the code from the `num-*.awk` library files.

The `num-*.awk` files are library files.

   * The code of all these files is already included in the `num` script.

   * You can use these library files in your own projects if you like.

The `num-test` script is a shell script that runs tests.

   * When a test runs, the script prints details, then SUCCESS or FAILURE.
