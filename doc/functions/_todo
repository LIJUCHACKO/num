## Quartiles

Quartiles divide an ordered data set into four equal parts.

  * Q0 is the minimum.
  * Q1 is the "middle" value in the first half of the rank-ordered data set.
  * Q2 is the median value in the set.
  * Q3 is the "middle" value in the second half of the rank-ordered data set.
  * Q4 is the maximum.

Num uses a weighted average to calculate quartiles, because this is robust. For details please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile and the "Method 3" description.


## Transforms

Transforms change the list.


#### unique

Keep unique values; omit the rest. TODO.

    echo "1 2 2 3 3 3" | num unique all
    1 2 3


#### difference, diff, interval

The difference between each number and the next number. TODO.

    echo "2 3 1 5" | num difference all
    1 -2 4


## Mappings

Mappings work on each value.



## Queries

Queries return TRUE as 1, or FALSE as 0.


#### is-unique

Is each item unique?

    echo "1 2 3" | num is-unique
    1

    echo "2 2 2" | num is-unique
    0


#### is-ascending, is-asc

Is the data ascending, i.e. each next number is greater or equal?

    echo "1 2 3" | num is-ascending
    1

    echo "3 2 1" | num is-ascending
    0


#### is-strictly-ascending, is-strict-asc

Is the data strictly ascending, i.e. each next number is greater?

    echo "1 2 3" | num is-strictly-ascending
    1

    echo "3 2 1" | num is-strictly-ascending
    0


#### is-non-ascending, is-non-asc

Is the data non-ascending, i.e. some next number is lesser?

    echo "1 2 3" | num is-non-ascending
    0

    echo "3 2 1" | num is-non-ascending
    1


#### is-descending, is-desc

Is the data descending, i.e. each next number is lesser or equal?

    echo "3 2 1" | num is-descending
    1

    echo "1 2 3" | num is-descending
    0


#### is-strictly-descending, is-strict-desc

Is the data strictly descending, i.e. each next number is lesser?

    echo "3 2 1" | num is-strictly-descending
    1

    echo "1 2 3" | num is-strictly-descending
    0


#### is-non-descending, is-non-desc

Is the data non-descending, i.e. some next number is greater?

    echo "3 2 1" | num is-non-descending
    0

    echo "1 2 3" | num is-non-descending
    1
