# Can open source succeed on Kickstarter? (The Top Ten Things I Learned)

TLDR: Yes, thanks to coworkers, friends, and family. I'm happy to answer questions here.

Thirty days ago I launched an open source software project called Num (http://www.numcommand.com). I tried an experiment using Kickstarter to fundraise. Today the Kickstarter campaign is complete and successful.

(If you want to fund, there are 8 hours to go: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joelparkerhenderson/num-number-utilities-for-mathematics)

Num is a command line tool for mathematics and statistics, so I pitched the project on Hacker News, relevant Reddit subgroups, relevant blogs/newsgroups/lists, and broadly on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. Also, I personally emailed dozens of experts in similar areas to ask for specific help.

1. Allies are everything. 80% of the funds are thanks to my existing group of coworkers, friends, and family. 20% of the funds are thanks to the kindness of strangers. Special thanks to BlueOtter.net and AdspaceNetworks.com.

2. Documentation is more fundable than source code. In the beginning of the campaign, people had many questions and comments; to help with this I wrote lots of docs, and spent much more time on the docs than the source code. Based on what I saw on Kickstarter, technical books seem to successfully reach funding goals, but open source software projects do not.

3. Approximately 20% of experts replied. Replies ranged from negative/dismissive ("don't do this", "it isn't worthy of funding") to positive/constructive ("great idea", "here's an optimization to speed up the inner loop"). Two people provided the bulk of the expert help for which I'm very grateful. Thank you Janis and John!

4. The experts who maintain related projects did not reply, except for one, and notably his software is the fastest I've ever seen. Props to Thomas and the `mawk` software. If you want an example of excellent pragmatic code, try mawk.

5. Outreach to the general public on social networks had minimal impact. Specifically, my technical postings on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. didn't result in many likes, retweets, shares, or dollars. Next time I'll try more-promotable postings with photos and videos.

6. Reddit subgroups are worthwhile. The discussion is thoughtful and relevant, the encouragement is helpful and high quality, and the followup is excellent. There are many people coding and sharing good advice and good projects.

7. Google indexing is fast. Within one week the Kickstarter project reached page one of Google results for the most important phrase ("num command"). Within three weeks the project website (www.numcommand.com) reached page one. This is all organic.

8. Kudos to the teams at GitHub, FastMail, and the R language community. It's a pleasure to interact with people who are smart, helpful, and especially nice. Much appreciated.

9. When a Kickstarter project reaches the end of its funding period, the Kickstarter site locks the project page. This means there's no way to do ongoing funding or expansion of features. IMHO this is a lost opportunity for Kickstarter to provide ongoing services to project creators and backers.

10. Because Kickstarter doesn't provide ongoing services, I'm setting up ongoing crowdfunding possibilities. I'm evaluating Patreon, Gratipay, Flattr, CentUp, Amazon Dev Pay, PayPal donation buttons, and Bitcoin. All of these look promising in various ways. I welcome comments and advice. The Patreon link is https://www.patreon.com/num and the first goal is $1000 for functional upgrades.
