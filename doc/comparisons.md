# Comparisons: when to use Num vs. other tools

Use Num when:

  * small data and small tasks
  * or one-time needs
  * or development-quality stability

Use other tools when you have:

   * large data and large tasks
   * or repeating needs and automation
   *  or production-quality stability

### When to use datamash, or qstats, etc.

We suggest these small compiled binaries when:

* You're a sysop or sysadmin.
* Your needs include systems automation.
* You think of numbers in terms of streams and pipes.
* You already use system tools, such as awk, grep, sed, make, etc.
* Your data set fits in available RAM and is suitable for Unix pipes.
* You want a quick way to pipe text to commands, with no dependencies.
* Your ideal tools are small, compiled once, with no dependencies, and no add ons.

### When to use R, or Julia, etc.

We suggest R and its tools, such as CRAN and R Studio, when:

* You're a statistician.
* Your needs include doing data exploration.
* You think of numbers in terms of vectors and functions.
* You already use a statistics tool, such as R Studio, Matlab, or Mathematica.
* Your data set fits comfortably in your computer's memory.
* You want a quick easy way to try visualizations and algorithms for yourself.
* Your ideal tools are on the leading edge of new statistics.

### When to use Python, or Scala, etc.

We suggest Python and its tools, such as pandas and scikit, when:

* You're a coder.
* Your needs include doing data pre-processing or post-processing.
* You think of numbers in terms of objects and messages, such as OOP methods.
* You already code in Python, Scala, Java, Perl, Ruby, Go, etc.
* Your data set exceeds your computer's memory.
* You want production environment deployments of visualizations and algorithms.
* Your ideal tools use a general purpose programming language.
