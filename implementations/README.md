# Num implemenations

This directory will contain Num implementations. This includes source code in a variety of languages.

We are starting the project with an implementation in `awk` because we believe this gives the widest reach for the most systems.

If you're a programmer and you would like to inplement Num in another language, we welcome your help. This directory has example subdirectories that you can use.
