## Contributing feedback by using GitHub isses

If you have ideas, or advice, or feedback, you can create a new GitHub issue.

This is good because all the project programmers have access to the issue, and all the users will be able to see the issue, add comments, and follow progress.


## Contributing help by using a pull request

We love pull requests for improvments to the project.

There are three easy steps:

1. Fork the repo.

  * Before you do any work please run our existing tests to make sure the code runs cleanly.

2. Work as you like.

   * Please create tests. This helps us know that all your code runs cleanly.

3. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

   * We'll take a look as soon as we can; this is typically within a business day.

Thank you again!
